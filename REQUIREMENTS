[PREREQUISITES INSTALLATION]
We have confirmed that SmartMark can be executed on a 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 system equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 2.10 GHz and 567GB RAM, where Python3.9 and Java 11.0.17 are installed.

- Install Python3.9 
  (sudo apt install python3.9)

- Install Java >= 11.0.8 
  (sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk)

- Download the executable EtherSolve (https://github.com/SeUniVr/EtherSolve_ICPC2021_ReplicationPackage.git) Jar file
  (EtherSolve builds the control flow graph of a smart contract, which is used as input of *SmartMark*)
  (The official EtherSolve tool has been tested with Java 11.0.8, so we believe that version or about will technically do)

To execute the SmartMark program, the pycryptodome python package needs to be installed. The installation command is as follows:
  $ pip3 install pycryptodome


[HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS]
  1. For the entire artifact, it takes up 9.2GB as we provide a large-scale smart contract dataset.
     We recommend users to have at least 10GB additional storage to obatin our artifact from FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21966875.v2).
  2. On GitHub repository (https://github.com/SKKU-SecLab/SmartMark.git), you can download selective portions of the dataset or just use the data in the samples folder.
