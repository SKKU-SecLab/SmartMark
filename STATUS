We want to claim the "Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable" and "Artifacts Available" badges.

The reasons are as follows:

- We have publicly released the artifact, which can be accessed from our GitHub repository and Figshare project.
- We have carefully documented the requirements and instructions for installing and running the SmartMark program and described each module in program, so that anyone can understand, execute, and even reproduce it.
- We have provided three types of dataset used in our empirical study, and described each dataset in details: How and Where did we get these data.
